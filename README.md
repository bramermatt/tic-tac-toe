# tic-tac-toe
Started 2024.11.13.

I want to make a game where my son and I can play Tic-Tac-Toe!

# My Guess
I'm just starting out here, and I'm going to do some research, but I believe this is going to be based on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## How Does Tic Tac Toe Work
- 2 players
  - X (player 1)
  - O (player 2)
- Player 1 goes first and places an X in 1 of 9 squares.
- Player 2 goes next and places an O in 1 of 8 squares (because 1 square is already placed).

- The Goal is 3 X/O in a ROW.
  - ROW is XXX in line or;
    - X
      - X
        - X or;
    - X
    - X
    - X
- If NO ROW MADE, THEN "DRAW".

## Need
- Game Board
  - 9 Squares
- 2 Players
  - X
  - O
- WIN Counter
